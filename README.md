This is the final project of Group 4 from class AI1903 for the DAP391m subject, advised by lecturer Do Thai Giang.

The objective of this project is to predict housing prices in Hanoi using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a regression model that can estimate the price of a house based on its features such as area, number of rooms, location, and other relevant attributes.

This repository includes:

- main.ipynb: the main Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

- data.csv: the dataset containing housing information collected for this project.

The notebook is designed to be clear, well-structured, and reproducible. For more information, please refer to the comments and markdown cells inside the notebook.
